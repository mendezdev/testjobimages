# Agile Engine Job test
Test job for AgileEngine.

## How to run it
Download MongoDB and install it with default credentials because the project use ir as it is.

Open solution with VS, build and press run button :D

It will run the API on `https://localhost:9697`

You can use the following endpoints: 
- `/api/images`
- `/api/images?page={pageNumber}`
- `/api/images/{id}`
- `/api/images/search/{searchTerms}` --> see the code comments for this endpoint

## Debts
- No tests of any kind

- No logic for improved for `/search` endpoint.

## Last words
I couldn't go more deeper because time restriction but it could be much better.

Thank you so much for the opportunity!
