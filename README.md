# Agile Engine Job test
Test job for AgileEngine

## How to run it
Download MongoDB and install it with default credentials because the project use ir as it is.

You can hit the API on `https://localhost:9697`: 
- `/api/images`
- `/api/images/{id}`
- `/api/images/search/{searchTerms}` --> see the code comments for this endpoint

## Debts
- No tests of any kind

- No logic for improved for `/search` endpoint.

## Ideas
- I couldn't go more deeper because time restriction but it could be much better

Thank you so much for the opportunity!
